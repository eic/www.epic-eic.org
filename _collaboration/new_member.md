# Welcome to the ePIC Collaboration 🎉

We are excited to welcome you to the **ePIC Collaboration**, the principal detector of the EIC. Whether you’re joining as a student, postdoc, scientist, or engineer, your contributions are essential to our success.

ePIC is a diverse, international effort to design, build, and operate a state-of-the-art detector system that will unlock the mysteries of nucleon and nuclear structure. To coordinate this work, the collaboration is organized into:

- **Physics Working Groups (PWGs)** – Develop and refine the physics program.  
- **Detector Subsystem Collaborations (DSCs)** – Design and build detector components.  
- **Software & Computing Groups** – Provide tools for simulation, reconstruction, and analysis.  
- **Collaboration Council (CC), Spokesperson Office & Coordination Teams** – Oversee governance, policies, membership, authorship, and strategy.  

👉 The [ePIC website](https://www.epic-eic.org/) is your hub for public documentation, group overviews, mailing lists, governance, and more.

This guide outlines the practical steps and resources to help you get started.
