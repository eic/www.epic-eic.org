#### About

This page provides information for people who are in the process of joining
the ePIC Collaboration.

#### Registration for BNL-based collaborative tools

At BNL, there are several services in active use by ePIC, where access requires a registration process for ePIC users involving 
- Indico: for meetings and conferences (indico.bnl.gov)
- The "phonebook", which is expanding into a more comprehensive system for managing the collaboration (phonebook.sdcc.bnl.gov/ePIC)
- A test invenioRDM server, which is for R&D on document handling

This is a multistep process involving
- CILogon: a federated authentication allowing access to BNL resources from a wide variety of sources 
- Comanage: a registry system to allow a user to access resources via several different login accounts
- ORCID: a free, unique and persistent ID system to associate a person with their various accounts

In particular, ORCID is a requirement for full access to ePIC resources.

The registration procedure is managed at BNL, and documentation both for first-time users, and people logging in with new credentials is [here](https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/information/comanage-setup-new-accounts).
