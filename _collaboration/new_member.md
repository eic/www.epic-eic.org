#### Welcome to the ePIC Collaboration

We are excited to welcome you to the **ePIC Collaboration**, the principal detector of the EIC. Whether you’re joining as a student, postdoc, scientist, or engineer, your contributions are essential to our success.
ePIC is a diverse, international effort to design, build, and operate a state-of-the-art detector system that will unlock the mysteries of nucleon and nuclear structure. To coordinate this work, the collaboration is organized into:
- **Physics Working Groups (PWGs)** – Develop and refine the physics program.  
- **Detector Subsystem Collaborations (DSCs)** – Design and build detector components.  
- **Software & Computing Groups** – Provide tools for simulation, reconstruction, and analysis.  
- **Collaboration Council (CC), Spokesperson Office (SP) & Coordination Teams** – Oversee governance, policies, membership, authorship, publications, and strategy.  

👉 The [ePIC website](https://www.epic-eic.org/){:target="_blank"} is your hub for public documentation, group overviews, mailing lists, governance, and more. 
This guide outlines the practical steps and resources to help you get started.

#### First Steps



##### 1. Subscribe to Mailing Lists  
* Mailing lists are the backbone of our communication. At a minimum, please subscribe to the main 
**Collaboration list**: [eic-projdet-collab-l](https://lists.bnl.gov/sympa/info/eic-projdet-collab-l){:target="_blank"}
* If you’re joining a **PWG**, mailing lists are listed under the **Physics** menu on our website.  
* For **DSCs**, see the [detector page](https://www.epic-eic.org/detector/dsc.html){:target="_blank"} for conveners, mailing lists, and meeting info.  

##### 2. Signing up for Mattermost  

* We use [Mattermost](https://chat.epic-eic.org/){:target="_blank"} as our main communication channel.
* To join email a request for an invitation to <eic-software-l-request@lists.bnl.gov>.

##### 3. Register to COmanage 
Access to collaborative tools at BNL requires registration. Key services include **Indico** and the user database (also known as the **Phonebook**, see below).  
To use ePIC services at BNL, follow these steps:

* **Register in COmanage**  
    COmanage is BNL’s central identity management system. It securely stores your verified identity and allows you to link multiple accounts (e.g., from your home institution, CERN, or BNL) into a single profile.  
  You can log in using your **home institution**, **BNL**, or **CERN** as your identity provider.  
  To register in COmanage, please use this link: [https://docs.sdcc.bnl.gov/services/comanage/](https://docs.sdcc.bnl.gov/services/comanage/){:target="_blank"}.  
  *Note that if you choose to log in with your SDCC account, you must have multi-factor [authentication](https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/information/unified-multi-factor-authentication){:target="_blank"} enabled.*

* **Provide Your ORCID**  
  An ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is required to access ePIC services. It ensures your identity is consistent across institutions and projects.  
  - Don’t have an ORCID? Create one for free: [ORCID Registration](https://orcid.org/register).  
  - Already have an ORCID? You can add it to your COmanage profile during registration — see [instructions here](https://docs.sdcc.bnl.gov/services/comanage/Add_ORCID_to_COperson/).

The COmanage registration request is usually processed within one business day.  
If you have any questions regarding your registration, please contact the **BNL Computing Center** at [RT-RACF-UserAccounts@bnl.gov](mailto:RT-RACF-UserAccounts@bnl.gov).

##### 4. Update the Phonebook  
The [ePIC Phonebook](https://phonebook.sdcc.bnl.gov/ePIC/){:target="_blank"} lists collaborators’ contact and institutional information.  
*Please make sure your entry in the **Phonebook** is up to date.*

If something is not correct:  
- Ask your **Council Representative** to update your entry, or  
- Email [Rachel](mailto:irachel@bnl.gov) with your details.  

##### 5. Access Indico  
Use **CILogon** to log in. It connects you to your home institution, BNL, or CERN and verifies your identity through COmanage. You’ll use it during both registration and login.  
Here is an example from Indico:<br>  
    <img height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc3c75a6-fb0e-4d8f-8f3d-f8b53c44d291" />
    
All meetings are organized via [Indico](https://indico.bnl.gov/category/402/){:target="_blank"}, including:  
- Collaboration meetings  
- Working group meetings  
- Tutorials  
- Conference preparation  

You can also subscribe to Indico calendar feeds to stay updated on upcoming meetings and events.

##### 6. The Document Database

To organize and manage its various research documents (papers, presentations, posters, graphics etc)
the ePIC Collaboration is leveraging the state-of-the-art **Zenodo** platform hosted at CERN. For
more information, please see [this page ]({% link _documents/zenodo.md %}){:target="_blank"} of
our website.

##### 7. For Council Representatives  
Council representatives are automatically subscribed to the **Council mailing list (ePIC-CC-l)**. Please review:  
- [Charter & Policies](https://www.epic-eic.org/collaboration/council.html){:target="_blank"}


##### 8. Talks & Conferences  
If you plan to present **ePIC results**, subscribe to:  
- Your primary **PWG/DSC mailing list**  
- [epic-talks](https://lists.bnl.gov/sympa/subscribe/epic-talks-l){:target="_blank"} 

##### 9. Software & Computing  
The [Getting Started guide](https://www.epic-eic.org/sc/getstarted.html){:target="_blank"} explains how to set up and contribute to the ePIC software framework.
