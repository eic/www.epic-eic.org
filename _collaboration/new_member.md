## Welcome to the ePIC Collaboration üéâ

We are excited to welcome you to the **ePIC Collaboration**, the principal detector of the EIC. Whether you‚Äôre joining as a student, postdoc, scientist, or engineer, your contributions are essential to our success.

ePIC is a diverse, international effort to design, build, and operate a state-of-the-art detector system that will unlock the mysteries of nucleon and nuclear structure. To coordinate this work, the collaboration is organized into:

- **Physics Working Groups (PWGs)** ‚Äì Develop and refine the physics program.  
- **Detector Subsystem Collaborations (DSCs)** ‚Äì Design and build detector components.  
- **Software & Computing Groups** ‚Äì Provide tools for simulation, reconstruction, and analysis.  
- **Collaboration Council (CC), Spokesperson Office (SP) & Coordination Teams** ‚Äì Oversee governance, policies, membership, authorship, publications, and strategy.  

üëâ The [ePIC website](https://www.epic-eic.org/) is your hub for public documentation, group overviews, mailing lists, governance, and more.

This guide outlines the practical steps and resources to help you get started.

## First Steps

### 1. Subscribe to Mailing Lists  
Mailing lists are the backbone of our communication. At a minimum, please subscribe to:

- **Collaboration list**: [eic-projdet-collab-l](https://lists.bnl.gov/sympa/info/eic-projdet-collab-l)  

If you‚Äôre joining a **PWG**, mailing lists are listed under the **Physics** menu on our website.  
For **DSCs**, see the [detector page](https://www.epic-eic.org/detector/dsc.html) for conveners, mailing lists, and meeting info.  

---

### 2. Signing up for Mattermost  

We use [Mattermost](https://chat.epic-eic.org/) as our main communication channel.

To join email a request for an invitation to [this address](eic-software-l-request@lists.bnl.gov).

### 3. Accessing ePIC Services at BNL  
Access to collaborative tools at BNL requires registration. Key services include Indico, and user database a.k.a. the Phonebook (see below).

To use ePIC services at BNL, follow these steps:

1. Register in COmanage

    COmanage is BNL‚Äôs central identity management system. It securely stores your verified identity and allows you to link multiple accounts (e.g., from your home institution, CERN, or BNL) into a single profile.

    - [Register in COmanage](https://docs.sdcc.bnl.gov/services/comanage/Register_for_SCDF_COmanage/) 

2. Use CILogon for Login

    CILogon connects you to your home institution, BNL, or CERN and verifies your identity with COmanage. You‚Äôll use it during both registration and login.

3. Provide Your ORCID

    An ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is required to access ePIC services. It ensures your identity is consistent across institutions and projects.

    - Don‚Äôt have an ORCID? Create one for free: [ORCID Registration](https://orcid.org/register).
    - Already have an ORCID? Add it to your COmanage profile during registration.

### 4. Update the Phonebook  
The [ePIC Phonebook](https://phonebook.sdcc.bnl.gov/ePIC/) lists collaborators‚Äô contact and institutional info.  

Please make sure that your entry in the phonebook is up-to-date. If something is not correct

- ask your **Council Representative** to update your entry, or  
- email [Rachel](mailto:irachel@bnl.gov) with your details  

üîë Don‚Äôt forget to add your **ORCID** (get one [here](https://orcid.org/)).  

---

### 5. Access Indico  
All meetings are organized via [Indico](https://indico.bnl.gov/category/402/), including:  

- Collaboration meetings  
- Working group meetings  
- Tutorials  
- Conference prep  

You can also subscribe to calendar feeds.

### 8. Talks & Conferences  
If you plan to present **ePIC results**, subscribe to:  

- Your primary **PWG/DSC mailing list**  
- [epic-talks](https://lists.bnl.gov/sympa/subscribe/epic-talks-l)  

---

### 9. Software & Computing  
The [Getting Started guide](https://www.epic-eic.org/sc/getstarted.html) explains how to set up and contribute to the ePIC software framework.
