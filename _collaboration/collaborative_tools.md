#### Overview

* Web  presence: the ePIC Collaboration is currently using [a Wiki-based website](https://wiki.bnl.gov/EPIC/index.php?title=Main_Page){:target="_blank"}
as its information portal. Migration to this website (__www.epic-eic.org__) is work in progress. See sections below for technical information.
* For meetings and agendas, there is a dedicated [ePIC Indico area](https://indico.bnl.gov/category/402/){:target="_blank"} hosted at BNL.
* There is an extensive set of ePIC-related mailing lists hosted at BNL. For more information about access please contact the corresponding
working group convener or a member of the leadership team.
* Document management: the ePIC Collaboration is actively maintaining its
[community within Zenodo (a repository hosted at CERN)](https://zenodo.org/communities/epic/){:target="_blank"}, which serves
as the platform for collaborative review process, storage and management of reasearch materials. To gain access to the protected
portion of the ePIC materials, please see intructions on the [document database page]({{ '/documents/zenodo.html' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}

#### About this website

##### Jekyll and Markdown

We leverage a very popular and efficient _static website generator_ technology which is widely used in industry and research: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}.
If you are familiar with GitHub you've probably encountered this before, since it's used in rendering of the optional _README.md_ files
in repositories and also as the main engine behind the _GitHub Pages_ platform.

It allows the contributors to use the easy-to-read [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){:target="_blank"}
annotation, which is then automatically, and transparently for the user, converted into HTML. This way
the cumbersome HTML editing as avoided. A simple example of the Markdown text such as used on this page
may look like this:

```markdown
External links: [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){:target="_blank"}

Itemized list:
* __item 1__ in bold
* _item 2_ in italics
```
...which is rendered as:

* __item 1__ in bold
* _item 2_ in italics

##### Data

Data content is handled in a way that effectively serves as a database (when the static website is compiled), without the need to deploy an
actual database server. This is achieved by storing the site data (when needed) in YAML-formatted or CSV files, which can be queried, parsed
and processed parsed using the powerful [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid){:target="_blank"} language.

##### Working on the content

The most optimal setup for the content development is to install Jekyll on your machine using the information
contained in the Jekyll link above. This requires a modicum of effort but is certainly not too difficult. It is
also possible to edit the material directly on _GitHub_ (see the section below) using the state-of-the-art
editor -- __VScode__. It is imperative that such direct edits, if they are necessary, are done in your own branch
(as opposed to "main") so as to not accidentally damage the ePIC website by making unintended or invalid changes.

##### GitHub: Managing the Content and Serving the Content

We use a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eic/www.epic-eic.org){:target="_blank"} to manage the code for this site.
Basic git/GitHub literacy is very helpful for efficient participation in the development of this site's content. In terms
of getting your new or updated content into the repo, the branch/pull request (PR) process is optimal.To get access to the code,
create a clone of the website repository and move to the directory created:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:eic/www.epic-eic.org.git
cd www.epic-eic.org
```

You should be able to create your own branch using the GitHub web interface, it's fairly straightforward. Then,
you can use a command line like the one below, to create a working copy of the branch on your workstation or
laptop:

```bash
git checkout my_cool_branch
```

After you commit the updated material to your branch and push it to GitHub, you will probably want to create
a "pull request", which will prompt the administrators of this site to review your commits and merge them
into main. After that the updated material will be rendered on the webpage. This is achieved by using the mechanism
of ''GitHub Pages'', which is a free service provided by GitHub and which automaticall renders the site
at the url: [https://eic.github.io/epic.github.io/](https://eic.github.io/epic.github.io/){:target="_blank"}

##### Documents, Images, Data

The ePIC Collaboration is leveraging [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/epic/){:target="_blank"} to systematize and
index a variety of its research documents in any format. This is the preferred method of publishing materials either in their
final shape, or approaching the final shape, for the collaboraiton. Storage of images, PDF and other files directly in repository
of this website (www.epic-eic.org) is __strongly discouraged__ due to GitHub features and limitations, and
other factors. Links to Zenodo, Google Drive, Dropbox or other such cloud media should be used instead.
