*Welcome to the ePIC Collaboration Council Page.*

The Collaboration Council (CC) is the governing body of the ePIC Collaboration of international institutions. The CC makes all major policy decisions within the Collaboration. Further details about the CC can be found in section 5 of the ePIC charter. The CC is lead by the elected Chair and Vice-chair who also maintain this web page.

##### Important Note

We are in the process of moving the current Indico Council pages into a new area that will be open to all ePIC collaborators but not to the general public. To access the new area you have to (i) be member of ePIC and listed in the [user DB](https://phonebook.sdcc.bnl.gov/ePIC/){:target="_blank"} (aka Phonebook) and (ii) you will need to register with COmanage. This is a one time quick registration that is described in our [new member pages](http://www.epic-eic.org/collaboration/new_member.html){:target="_blank"}. Please do so at your earliest convenience. 

##### Council Meetings

The list of all council meetings past and upcoming/planned can be found [here (old)](https://indico.bnl.gov/category/437/){:target="_blank"} and here (new) (https://indico.bnl.gov/category/641/){:target="_blank"}. The next meeting is on November 25, 2025.
