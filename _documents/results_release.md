This page briefly describes the procedure for releasing official ePIC results. The full policy can be found on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/15390156](https://zenodo.org/records/15390156){:target="_blank"}


Types of ePIC result tags
* Published results: **ePIC** 
* Physics results: **ePIC Preliminary**
* Performance results
  *  **ePIC Test Beam**: results based on test beam data
  *  **ePIC Computing**: results related to software and computing infrastructure, algorithm, flow chart, plans, DAQ, etc.
  *  **ePIC Performance**: results based on simulation, cosmic ray data, real data, etc.
  *  **ePIC Simulation**: results based on simulation, machine learning, etc.
  *  **ePIC Technical**: technical/engineering drawings
* Work in progress: **ePIC Work In Progress**
 

Procedure:
* **Step 0**: Present regular updates to working groups
* **Step 1**: Send official request to working groups for approval in writing, e.g., via emails
  * For physics results, approval from coordinators are needed 
* **Step 2**: Upload approved results, along with required documents if any, to the official repository (Zenodo)
