exceptional circumstances and needs to be approved by the ePIC leadership team.

All photos are vetted. Please contact Renee Fatemi, the Vice-Chair of the Colaboration Councul

the ePIC Community on Zenodo, and

For the photos showing people the publishing person needs to receive their conscent before sharing.
Photos of equipment, hardware etc need to be approved by the reffering DSCs before the final approval
by Renee. You are free to use them in talks and publications.
